\begin{abstract}
ADAMS is a modular Java framework for developing workflows to be used for
academic research as well as commercial applications. It integrates
data mining applications, like MOA, WEKA, MEKA and R, image and video
processing and feature generation capabilities, spreadsheet and database
access, visualizations, GIS, webservices, fast protoyping of new 
functionality using scripting languages (Jython/Groovy).

\section{Introduction}
The origins of ADAMS lie in academia, with the project getting developed to process analytical data from gas-chromatography mass-spectrometry instruments (\cite{gcms}), handling the many pre-processing steps and various predictions in parallel. However, the ADAMS framework now forms the basis of commercial applications, as it allows for rapid development of data mining applications that integrate into business processes. The framework, written in Java and released under GPLv3\footnote{\url{http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.txt}{}}, consists of various modules grouped by functionality. It includes MOA (\cite{moa}), WEKA (\cite{weka}), MEKA, R, image/video processing and feature generation, spreadsheet and database handling, various visualizations, GIS support through OpenStreetMap, webservices, and scripting (Jython or Groovy) for fast prototyping.

The remainder of the paper is structured as follows: first, a short introduction into the framework is given. Second, a short overview of some of the research areas that it can be used for. Third, a commercial application that is based on the framework.

\section{Framework}
Workflow systems, like RapidMiner, KNIME or Kepler, use a canvas approach for placing the operators and combining them by connecting them. On the one hand, this is a very intuitive approach, since the user can see how the data flows. On the other hand, this can make modifying the flow a tedious process, as the authors experienced: disconnecting operators, moving them around, inserting other operators, reconnecting operators. Despite birds-eye-view and meta-operators that group several operators together, the canvas approach can quickly become hard to comprehend and doesn't seem to scale well into hundreds or even thousands of operators.

\end{figure}

ADAMS forfeits some of the advantages and asthetics of this canvas approach to provide a more compact layout (see Figures \ref{example_flow} and \ref{example_output} for an example flow with associated output), using a simple tree structure instead for organizing its operators (called actors). The nesting of nodes in the tree resembles the nesting of actors programmatically, based on whether the actor is a primitive one (e.g., filtering a dataset) or one that manages other actors (e.g., grouping actors to be executed sequentially). So-called control actors determine data flow and flow execution: a \icon{Branch} Branch actor forwards the incoming data to all of its sub-actors, i.e., the sub-branches; a \icon{Sequence}~Sequence actor executes its sub-actors one-by-one using the output of one actor as the input for the next one. The four types of combinations that result from input and output handling, are as follows: \icon{CallableActors}~Standalone, which has no input nor output, e.g., a database connection; \icon{MOAStream}~Source, which only generates output; \icon{MOAClassifierEvaluation}~Transformer, which takes input and generates output; \icon{SequencePlotter}~Sink, which only consumes data. By using data flow control actors, it is possible to get rid of explicit connections between the actors. However, a tree structure only handles 1-to-n connections. In order to simulate n-to-m semantics, several techniques are implemented: use of containers to combine multiple outputs; support for variables, to be attached to parameters of actors or simply used for calculations; internal key-value storage for storing, retrieving and updating data in multiple locations; callable actors can be invoked from anywhere in the flow. Interoperability of actors is statically checked by comparing the types of data that a preceding actor can output and what types the following actor can handle. This type information in combination with the context induced by the tree structure, makes it possible to limit the actors that can be placed within this context. Furthermore, context-aware rules can be specified for common sequences of actors (e.g., load dataset $\rightarrow$ set class attribute $\rightarrow$ cross-validate dataset $\rightarrow$ output results) aiding the user in creating flows more rapidly.

Adding new actors is very easy: all it needs is a class either derived from one of the abstract superclasses or implementing the core interfaces for actors, placed in one of the packages which ADAMS inspects for actors and a little icon to be displayed in the editor.

\section{Research}
With its roots in academia, ADAMS is a well-positioned for research. One of the standalone tools for stream analysis is MOA, which offers a simple user interface for running experiments, evaluating algorithms. However, in a workflow context, this becomes much more interesting, as you can apply filters to the data and compare several algorithms on the data stream in parallel, plotting their performance in a single plot (see Figures \ref{example_flow} and \ref{example_output}). It is possible to perform classification and regression experiments, as well as cluster visualizations (see Figure \ref{cluster_visualization}).

Another area of research is Tweet analysis: ADAMS allows you to record tweets and their associated meta-data using the public API, storing them for future replay. This tweet stream replay functionality allows you to perform the same experiment as often as required, using the same stream of tweets, applying different filters and/or algorithms. Tweets with geotagging information can be displayed using the OpenStreetMap GIS functionality, allowing for visualization of geographical phenomena.

Due to a recently started collaboration with the Biology department, processing videos has been added to ADAMS. Videos get processed in near real-time, with frames being obtained at specific intervals. Apart from tracking objects, in our case tracking mice and rats during an experiment (see Figure \ref{object_tracking_mouse}), it is also possible to use the image processing and feature generation functionality to generate input for machine learning algorithms, like MOA or WEKA.

\section{Industry}
One of our commercial applications based on the ADAMS framework is used for spectral analysis, e.g., near-infrared (NIR), mid-infrared (MIR) and X-ray fluorescence (XRF). One of our customers, BLGG AgroXpertus\footnote{\url{http://blgg.agroxpertus.nl/}{}}, is a large environmental laboratory in Europe with multiple sites across Europe. Traditionally, such a laboratory analyzes plant and soil samples using wet chemistry, which not only includes the analysis itself, which can take up to a week, but also a lengthy sample preparation process beforehand (e.g., drying and grinding). However, when analyzing the samples in tandem with a spectral technique, it is possible to build regression models to predict the various concentrations that are determined with wet chemistry, therefore reducing the number of samples that need to get analyzed the traditional way. The number of data points per raw spectrum depends on the method and instrument, but is roughly 10,000 for XRF, 2,000 for MIR and 1,500 for NIR. The largest model for NIR is for soil and encompasses about 150,000 spectra. Altogether, BLGG uses about 250 different models for predicting the various properties. During normal operation, 1,000 samples are processed each data, but during soil season (per legislation, every farmer in the Netherlands has to send in samples every four years) this goes up to 2-3,000 per day. The system has been in place since 2006 and saves them, at the time of writing, 17 million~\euro{} per annum and 30 million~\euro{} per annum during soil season, by simply reducing the number of samples that need to go to wet chemistry for analysis and being able to scale up their operations. This is a good example for Kiri Wagstaff's \textit{Impact Challenge ``\$100M saved through improved decision making provided by an ML system''} that she posed in 2012 for \textit{machine learning that matters} (\cite{wagstaff}).

One difference to the default ADAMS framework is, that this system uses meta-flows. With these meta-flows, the customer simply defines certain properties for cleaning, modelling and evaluation. So-called generators then take these settings and turn them into worker flows (with thousands of actors) to perform all the various low-level steps for the different models.
